# Software Engineering University
With the aim of becoming a better SW engineer, I have created this repository whose purpose is to study 
each and every point contained in the famous GitHub repository "Coding Interview University" 
(https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university), as well as expanding the topics presented there.

This README is going to be updated, but now it is possible find my actual project dedicated to Design Patterns here:
